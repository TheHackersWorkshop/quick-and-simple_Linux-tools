This Python script searches for files on your Linux system using wildcards.
You provide a filename pattern (e.g., *.sh) and a directory to start the search (defaulting to /media), and the script recursively lists all matching files.
It safely skips system directories that can cause errors (/proc, /sys, /run, /dev) and streams results incrementally to avoid memory issues.
Errors from inaccessible files are reported but do not stop the search, making it a robust, universal file-finding tool.

## Updated to allow to search from root without crashing.
