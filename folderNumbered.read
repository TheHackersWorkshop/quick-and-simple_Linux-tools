This script creates a series of numbered directories in the current working directory. 
You can optionally provide a prefix for the directory names; if left blank, directories will be named with just numbers (e.g., 01, 02, …).
You are prompted to enter the total number of directories to create, and the script validates that this is a positive integer.
Directories are created sequentially with zero-padded numbers, and a confirmation message shows the range of directories created.
